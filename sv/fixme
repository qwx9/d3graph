- data types: bool, string, bounded real (]0,1[ etc), proportion, etc.
- frequency set: must select one (default), can't just dangle
- implement cross-object references: seq, tree, model, etc.
	. practically everything can be referenced
	. but referencing another object is restricted
- implement cross-object suboptions references and aliasing
- remove objects
- add submit -> compile text file and show result
- error checking: keep track of what's needed: constraints unmet
	. we know ahead of time what's missing
	. or do we? what happens if we add aliases etc?
	. might not be an issue
	. in other words, barring other problems during compilations,
	we can warn of missing shit ahead of time,
	just by keeping track of a todo list
	. update: delete/add/modify shit
- add a way to name and reference tree nodes
	. default names, or indices from files?
	. no error checking since we can't parse tree anyway
	. just always use indices for nodes?
	. user could specify tree shape?
- implement selecting a file, saving filepath
- variable naming in bpp: model1-2-3: model1 parameter _1, see how shit is automatically named
	. important for references
	. HKY85.kappa_1, not model1.kappa
	. but in spec: process1=Nonhomogeneous(model1=1, model2=2)
		tree=2, rate=1, etc.
- actually submit data to server
- serialization + pov of model collections -> verification/inconsistance: suppression, ajout de modeles, ref, etc
- if there's an error on input which bppml detects immediately:
	. show query page with same parametrization and error messages
	. allow basically recompiling the config and sending new files
		* or keeping old otherwise
- implement all options from bpp manual
	. some are hierarchical: one alphabel -> set of possible models
- fix seldom/datdom silliness
- index1, index2: accessoire
- output mandatory .profile to ease postprocessing
- null checks, other error checking, asserts
- presentation idea:
	. tabs?
	. left pane: list of model components
	. right pane: onselect, description
	. group components this way, avoids all on one page
	. still, only representation, still need data and relationships
- could also hide/unhide obj panes via css or w/e
- csshit for pretty
- re-check visualization if time remains
- notes
	. bypass cache: ^F5
	. alert(string);
