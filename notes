- reselect + bare options no longer works, should be parm=val, not parm(val)
- types for one/once/any
	* ROne, ROnce, RAny in place of RObj, RSelect, etc
	* used to disable existing params in dom
	* index: depends on whether or not multiple (duplicated) values are allowed
- type for misc parameter: string translated directly
	* RVerbatim?
	* example → other tree params
- implement top-level options and alpha/seq/tree-specific options
	* need to decouple sym from label more, as well as numbering
- RPtr type or similar and separate tables
	* like RRef, not included in compilation, just a indirection/dereferenciation
	* maybe RRef == RPtr? but it's for rules, not values
		- RRuleRef?
- fix param references/RRef
	* skip RRef name in compilation
	* reference actually refers to model rule name, not model index
	⇒ two types of RRef? indexed and non-indexed?
	* only indexed refs are tree roots → model1,2,3 tree1,2,3 seq1,2,3
		- therefore no need
- referencing indexed elements ≠ their params → phyl, etc
- implement list based on predicate (model list based on alphabet)
	* multiple rule tables and refs between them
	* distribution table, model tables by type
	* refs to trees of rules, mutable or not
	* these things can be intermixed for more complex situations and weird models
		- any model with any whatever
		- so, associative arrays? arrays with all (redundant) possibilities?
		  array of concatenated sets?
- references for trees/seqs/models/etc: different type of RRef?
	* refs are indices, not names
	* multiple and exclusive values: combination of phyl or proc + data
		=> maybe final phylogeny is refs to phylogeny + op ≠ any phylogeny, proc + data
- valid bpp output

- output ui result and edit prior to submit ⇒ textarea
	* manually upload bpp file ⇒ load into text area
	* then submit as is
	* make sure we don't overwrite gui state if the text was changed manually
- start thinking about ruleset spec language and transpilation to ts
- visuals/css: minimal css-only framework
	* tooltips for description/type/information/links to doc
	* left pane: list of model components
	* right pane: onselect, description
	* hide unused/uninitialized primitives?
	* do as little css customization as possible
- error checking
	* either traverse the trees on submit, generate constraints and remove those met on the fly, then emit those that remain
	* or keep state around without recalculating anything, but more bug-prone
	* file paths



- val.ts: ValueElem .el in interface and add standard .set() and .pop()/.nuke()/etc

- ref sym ref's need to skip the actual ref element, so does compilation


- bppml specific options
- aliases
	* forward/backward aliases?




- customize file input shit
	* button/text area both clickable, etc: combine if possible
	* file type?
- dom.val: paren management is fucked
- select/list on root, should behave same as anywhere else
- add terminal list option → has its own [x], shouldn't
- maybe we don't even need to save any dom state in the dom objects, besides container
- VString: check if string is admissible/valid
	* is this even used anywhere? check (i/o params etc)
- required arguments? -> auto add
- add a way to name and reference tree nodes
	. default names, or indices from files?
	. no error checking since we can't parse tree anyway
	. just always use indices for nodes?
	. user could specify tree shape?
	⇒ no parsing, user does this manually, fuck it
- variable naming in bpp: model1-2-3: model1 parameter _1, see how shit is automatically named
	. important for references
	. HKY85.kappa_1, not model1.kappa
	. but in spec: process1=Nonhomogeneous(model1=1, model2=2)
		tree=2, rate=1, etc.
- documentation, links towards
	* note: as stateless as possible (which also means redundancies)


- frequency set: must select one (default), can't just dangle
- if there's an error on input which bppml detects immediately:
	. show query page with same parametrization and error messages
	. allow basically recompiling the config and sending new files
		* or keeping old otherwise
- implement all options from bpp manual
- index1, index2: accessoire
